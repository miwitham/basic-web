# Basic Web Project

This is an EXTREMELY basic template for web development.

## How to read this file properly

Go ahead and press `ctrl` + `shift` + `v` to view this in preview mode and seeing it in a richtext-friendly mode.

## Getting up and running

Go ahead and install the extension recommended in this workspace. If for some reason VSCode does not automatically recommend it for installation you can use the URL for the following extension to install liveserver:

```plaintext
Name: Live Server
Id: ritwickdey.LiveServer
Description: Launch a development local Server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages
Version: 5.7.9
Publisher: Ritwick Dey
VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
```

1. Familiarize yourself with the pretty simple set of files.

   - `index.html` is for the basic structure of the page (but it can be programatically modified with JavaScript).`
   - `index.js` is for the JavaScript and the fanciest stuff for your page.
   - `index.css` is for doing the fancier styling for everything.

Technically, all of this can be accomplished in the `index.html` solely but separation of concerns and all that. Still VSCode is cool enough that it will provide syntax highlighting and intellisense inside of the HTML file if you really wanted.

2. Click the **Go Live** button in the lower right corner as seen in this screenshot. If you haven't installed the extension mentioned above it won't be there yet.

3. Your project will be loaded and you can start developing! Every time you save a file you'll have an instant live-reload.
